This script takes user input to search for prices of a stock, commodity, etf, or asset within a specific asset class. Asset classes include stocks, etfs, funds, bonds, indices, commodities, and crypto.

In order to run this script, you'll first need to create an account at [EODHistoricalData](https://eodhistoricaldata.com/cp/settings) and generate an API. EOD Historical Data has a free tier which is all we'll need for this script.

Python packages include requests, pandas, and sys.
